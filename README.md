# Volleyball-Rotations-App

*Purpose:*
Create visually appealing app for volleyball teams to create rotations

*How it works:*
1. User will be asked if there will be substitutes or not (y/n).
   - If the user selects "n", the user will input names of all players for each of the required positions.
   - If the user selects "y", the user will be asked if each of the input players will play front-row, back-row, or both.
     - If the answer is not "both" for a player, the user will be asked to input a name for the substitute of that player.
2. The program will then generate all six rotations based on the users' inputs and store it as an object.
3. The program will print out the six rotations.
